# Matasano Crypto Challenges

Working through the [matasano challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)

My goals are :
* Learn Rust
* Refresh old cryptology concepts
* Learn new ones
* Get comfortable using Cargo to structure projects and write libraries

I am currently separating the library into modules corresponding to sets and will export a function for each challenge even if it's output isn't strictly usable or composable. I will also write test cases as I go corresponding to the actual challenges.
